[Zplugin](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) can use the NPM package registry
to automatically:

- get the plugin's Git repository OR release-package URL,
- get the list of the recommended ices for the plugin,
    - there can be multiple lists of ices,
    - the ice lists are stored in *profiles*; there's at least one profile, *default*,
    - the ices can be selectively overriden.

Example Zplugin invocations that'll install
[zdharma/zsh-github-issues](https://github.com/zdharma/zsh-github-issues):

```zsh
# Download the default profile. Need the `@' prefix because of the `git' ice.
zplugin pack for @github-issues-srv
```

## Default Profile

The package is the puller-thread service for the `zdharma/zsh-github-issues`
plugin. It runs the background service that downloads the new issues from
GitHub.

The Zplugin command executed will be equivalent to:

```zsh
zplugin lucid service"GIT" \
 pick"zsh-github-issues.service.zsh" for \
    zdharma/zsh-github-issues
```
